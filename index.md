## CompTIA Security+ Certified

*August 24, 2025*

After some more studying, I've passed the Security+ exam, right on the heels of Network+.
It feels I'm inching closer and closer to something. I know I'm more knowledgable
coming out the other side.


## CompTIA Network+ Certified

*July 20, 2025*

I'm Network+ certified. I studied for about a month and passed. I've come to appreciate
certificates freshen up what I know and offer some proof. It's not as easy to move up
without them.
