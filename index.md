My name is James Corley. Here you'll find projects, new ideas, what I know, and
what I'm discovering.

## CompTIA Security+ Certified

*August 24, 2025*

Right on the heels of Network+, I've passed the Security+ exam. It feels I'm inching closer 
and closer to something. I know I'm more knowledgable coming out on the other side.


## CompTIA Network+ Certified

*July 20, 2025*

I'm Network+ certified. I studied for about a month and passed. I've come to appreciate
certificates freshen up what I know and offer some proof. It's not as easy to move up
without them.
