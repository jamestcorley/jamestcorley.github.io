I spent the better part of the day creating this website.
I was thinking of creating it months ago. Now that Iâ€™m certified
in Security+ and Network+, I decided to create this dedicated space
to support my career growth and show my work.

This was my first time using GitHub Pages, so I had to learn how the pieces
fits together. Most of the process involved getting comfortable with front
matter and templating inside Markdown files but it's all straightforward.

It was interesting to see how powerful a static site can be.

Setting this up was a good reminder that learning by doing is the best way to
grow.
