I spent most of the next day after passing my Security+ certification building this website. This space is meant to help support my career growth by showing both what I know and what I can do. Taking what's in my mind and making it real.

The top two reasons GitHub Pages was chosen is because it's built for version control and has zero cost. However it also offers full control to create what I want, simplicity in use, and reliability which is especially important when you are busy doing or planning on doing other projects. Setup was pretty quick and involved organizing front matter, writing content in Markdown, and editing templates. I really only used the GitHub Pages Quickstart documentation at [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

In addition to my blog and resume, I have a Projects page. Listed on the page is command line utility called Reflow, it allows copying of command output to the clipboard by redirecting the flow. It's very useful when working on my homelab which contains quite a few other projects I work on. Take a look and see if it can be useful to you too.

This was a definite success. It's interesting to see how useful a static site can be and what can be done in a short amount of time.
