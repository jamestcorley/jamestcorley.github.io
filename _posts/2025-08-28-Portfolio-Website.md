I spent most of the next day after passing my Security+ certification building this website. This space is meant to help support my career growth by showing both what I know and what I can do. Taking what's in my mind and putting it out in to the world.

When I chose GitHub Pages for the task, the top two reasons were version control and cost. However it also offers full control to create what I want, simplicity in use, and reliability which is especially important when I am busy doing or planning on doing other projects. I also like the default choice of Markdown files which I've been using for several years with the Obsidian notes app. Setup was pretty quick and involved organizing front matter, writing content in Markdown, and editing templates. To get started I would suggest the GitHub Pages Quickstart documentation at [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

In addition to my blog and resume, I have a Projects page which I plan to expand as time goes on. Currently listed on the page is a command line utility called Reflow, it allows copying of command output to the clipboard by redirecting the flow. It's very useful when working on my homelab which contains quite a few educational and personal projects I work on. Take a look and see if it can be useful to you too.

This was a success. It's interesting to see how useful a static site can be and what can be done in a short amount of time.
