I spent the better part of the day creating this website.
I was thinking of creating it months ago, but life and work pushed it
to the back. Now that Iâ€™m certified in Security+ and Network+, I decided
to create this dedicated space to showcase my work and support my career
growth.

This was my first time using GitHub Pages, so I had to learn how everything
fits together. Most of the process involved getting comfortable with front
matter and templating inside Markdown files but it's all straightforward having
grown up working with HTML and CSS and using Markdown in the Obisidian app for
notetaking. 

Still it was interesting to see how powerful a static site can be.

Setting this up was a good reminder that learning by doing is the best way to
grow.
