Iâ€™m Network+ certified and it feels like the fog has lifted. I've come to appreciate and
understand certificates help freshen up what I know and offer tangible proof of my skills. When I
first got my foot in the door, I assumed I only needed the A+ for the intial step and that I could move
up based on experience alone the rest of the way. I didn't realize how valuable being certified is
until I started talking to people and doing research.

Studying for the exam, I used resources from Andrew Ramdayal, Anthony Dion, and Jason Messer. Using multiple sources
of information helped fill in gaps that were missing. After I had the information in my head, I scheduled the exam.
As the date started approaching, I took practice tests to help identify weak spots, looked over the study material I
was weak in. I then took more practice tests. Before I knew it, it was time and I took the actual test and passed.

The fog has been lifted and I can see my career stretching out in front of me. I'm planning on pursuing Security+. It's
one of the most valuable foundational certifications in IT. When it comes to career advancement, it seems even more
valuable than Network+. I look forward to the future and I don't know where the journey will take me but I feel
it's going to be a ride.
