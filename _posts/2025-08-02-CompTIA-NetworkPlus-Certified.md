Iâ€™m Network+ certified and it feels like I can see a path ahead. I've come to appreciate and
understand certificates help freshen up what I know and offer tangible proof of my skills. When I
first got my foot in the door, I assumed I only needed the A+ for the initial step and that I could move
up based on experience alone the rest of the way. I didn't realize how valuable being certified is
until I started talking to people and doing research.

Studying for the exam, I used resources from Andrew Ramdayal, Anthony Dion, and Jason Messer. The reason I used multiple
teachers was to help ensure there were less gaps in my knowledge. After studying for a bit and getting the information in
my head, I scheduled the exam. I had read online from multiple people that studying too long can actually be detrimental
and cause burnout which was one reason why I didn't want to delay.

As the date started approaching, I took practice tests to help identify weak spots and then looked over the study material
I was weak in. I then took more practice tests in the following days. Before I knew it, it was time. I went to the Pearson
VUE center feeling a bit anxious. They provided me some earplugs and a whiteboard, and lead me into one of the rooms. In the
room there were multiple computers. I picked one and sat down. While taking the test I realized I still had some gaps in my
knowledge and I was feeling a it anxious. I had put the earplugs in early on but had take them out. The lack of sound was
actually causing me to be more nervous and time was flying by. I left the lab tests for last. I knew I wouldn't be able to
get through them completely but I did my best with the little remaining time I had. Then I was done. I went through the exam
and completed the questionnaire at the end which I really think should be displayed after you see your score or not at all.
Finally, there was my score on the screen. And I passed. That's when the weight lifted and I couldn't help but smile for the
rest of the day. It was a great feeling.

I can see my career stretching out in front of me now and I'm planning on pursuing the Security+ next. It's one of the most
valuable foundational certifications in IT. When it comes to career advancement, it seems to be more valuable than Network+.
I look forward to the future. I don't know where the journey will take me but I know it's going to be an interesting ride
along the way.
